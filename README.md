I actively participated in the maintenance of the Ad Exchange project, adhering to the Kanban system for task management. We conducted daily team meetings via Google Meet. I was responsible for configuring cron jobs for statistics and creating new materialized views in ClickHouse. Effective communication within the team and across various departments was facilitated through Slack.
The primary focus of our efforts was to enhance the existing product, which was live. This involved meticulously verifying the accuracy of openRTB requests from our partners (SSP) and the correctness of responses from third-party sources and our internal chipboard. I made significant contributions to the project's future by introducing numerous innovative enhancements.</em>

Oversaw the IT department, holding positions as a Unity Frontend Engineer and a Middle Backend Engineer. The primary focus was on task allocation through Asana and the refinement of completed projects in accordance with SOLID principles. Recently, we transitioned to a microservices architecture, configured for Nginx and Docker containers, and deployed on Amazon EC2.
I also handled the integration of payment systems such as Payfast and CryptoCoin. Our daily routine commenced with a team Skype call, addressing current tasks, implementation options, and deadlines. At day's end, we consolidated tasks and updated statuses within the Asana system.</em>

_If you hold the belief that programmers are mundane individuals, allow me to debunk that myth. As developers, we devote our efforts to solving intricate technical challenges, and we take pride in resolving any errors we encounter along the way. In fact, the process of debugging brings a unique sense of fulfillment and adds to the richness and complexity of our lives._
