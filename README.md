      Over the course of my career spanning more than four years, I have gained substantial experience in various facets of software development and project management. I have honed my skills in web application and software development, developed strategies for business growth, managed finances, optimized operational efficiency, and excelled in leadership roles where I conducted managerial training and negotiations.

During a particular project focused on Ad Exchange, I played an integral role in its maintenance. I followed the Kanban task management system diligently and regularly participated in team meetings conducted via Google Meet. In this capacity, I was responsible for configuring cron jobs for statistics and creating materialized views in ClickHouse to enhance data analysis. My strong communication skills facilitated effective collaboration both within the team and with various departments, using platforms like Slack.

My primary objective within the project was to enhance an existing live product. This involved meticulous validation of openRTB requests from our partners (SSP) and ensuring the correctness of responses from third-party sources, as well as our internal platform. I made significant contributions by introducing numerous innovative enhancements to propel the project's future growth.

In a separate role, I served as both a Unity Frontend Engineer and a Middle Backend Engineer while overseeing the IT department. In this capacity, I was responsible for task allocation using Asana and ensuring the alignment of projects with SOLID principles. Additionally, I was involved in transitioning our architecture to a microservices model, configuring it with Nginx and Docker containers, and deploying it on Amazon EC2. I also managed the integration of payment systems, such as Payfast and CryptoCoin. My daily routine involved team discussions via Skype, focusing on current tasks, implementation strategies, and meeting deadlines. At the end of each day, I consolidated tasks and updated statuses within the Asana system.

_If you hold the belief that programmers are mundane individuals, allow me to debunk that myth. As developers, we devote our efforts to solving intricate technical challenges, and we take pride in resolving any errors we encounter along the way. In fact, the process of debugging brings a unique sense of fulfillment and adds to the richness and complexity of our lives._
